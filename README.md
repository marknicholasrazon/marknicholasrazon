# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Mark Nicholas Razon**, a full-stack developer based in **Laguna, Philippines.**

In addition, I provide freelance work for clients in the areas of full stack development, data analytics, web and graphic design, and code lessons.

Through the use of digital solutions, I've aided small and medium-sized enterprises and organizations in expanding and streamlining their operations. I've also created a community of developers who help each other out by sharing tools, information, mentoring, support, and many other things. I like reading about upcoming technologies, minimalism, and startup culture when I'm not doing code. I blog about my learnings or offer little films of what I've discovered.
